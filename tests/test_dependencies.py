"""What this repo needs is what its pyproject says, in each of the ways it says it.

A package that imports something nobody declared works on the machine that
happened to have it and dies on the merge gate, which installs exactly what the
pyproject says; so does a version nobody bounded, a sibling checkout nobody
recorded, and a Python floor no run proves.  The gates are the family's
(``app_support.dependencies``); what is here is which packages are this repo's
own and which trees to read.
