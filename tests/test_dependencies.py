"""Every third-party import in scripture is a dependency pyproject declares.

A launcher that imports a package nobody declared works on the machine that
happened to have it and dies on the merge gate, which installs exactly what the
pyproject says.  The gate is the family's (``app_support.dependencies``); what
is here is which packages are this repo's own.
