## Test fixtures must be fabricated, never copied from the real library

Every fixture value that stands in for library data — a video title, a filename,
a performer or studio name, prompt text — must be **invented**. Never paste a
real one out of the media library to make a test feel realistic.

This is not a style note. It is the single thing that has actually leaked private
data into these repos: an agent writing a test reached for a real filename or
performer name because it was handy, and it rode into a public commit. Nothing in
the app's *design* pulls library text into source — the library lives outside
every repo, read at runtime through the git-ignored overlays — so this habit is
the only remaining path for a real name to get committed, and the only thing
stopping it is you following this rule.

Do not lean on the sanitize guard to catch it. `tools/sanitize_guard.py` fails
the suite when a **known** blocked term appears in the tracked tree, but a brand-
new performer name it has never seen passes every check and lands. The guard is a
backstop for names already known; it cannot see the next one.

So fabricate fully. Use `Jane Doe`, `Example Studio`, `scene one`, the
`alpha`/`beta`/`gamma` act placeholders the committed `content.example.json`
already uses. The near miss that still counts: taking a real filename and
changing a character or two — it is still that clip, still that performer. Make
it up from scratch, don't lightly edit a real one.
